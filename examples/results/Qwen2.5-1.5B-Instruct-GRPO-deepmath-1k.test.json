        "generated_text": " To evaluate the given integral using Fubini's Theorem, we first need to understand the region of integration. The region is defined by \\(0 \\leq y \\leq \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(y \\leq x \\leq \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\). This means that the integral can be written as \\( \\int_{0}^{\\pi/2}\\int_{y}^{\\pi/2}y\\frac{\\sin x}{x}dx \\, dy \\). We can use Fubini's Theorem to interchange the order of integration. The new region of integration is defined by \\(0 \\leq x \\leq \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(0 \\leq y \\leq x\\). So, the integral becomes \\( \\int_{0}^{\\pi/2}\\int_{0}^{x}y\\frac{\\sin x}{x}dy \\, dx \\). Now, we can integrate with respect to \\(y\\) first: \\( \\int_{0}^{\\pi/2}y\\frac{\\sin x}{x}dy = \\frac{\\sin x}{x} \\int_{0}^{\\pi/2}ydy = \\frac{\\sin x}{x} \\left[ \\frac{y^2}{2} \\right]_{0}^{\\pi/2} = \\frac{\\sin x}{x} \\cdot \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{\\sin x}{8x} \\).

This integral is known as the sine integral, and its value is \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\cdot \\text{Si}(\\pi/2) \\), where \\(\\text{Si}(x)\\) is the sine integral function. The value of \\(\\text{Si}(\\pi/2)\\) is approximately 0.946087812449. So, the final answer is \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\cdot 0.946087812449 = 0.118260976806 \\). </think><answer>0.118260976806</answer>",

The normal approximation to the exponential distribution is a normal distribution with mean equal to the mean of the exponential distribution and standard deviation equal to the square root of twice the mean. In this case, the mean is 600 hours, so the normal distribution has a mean of 600 and a standard deviation of sqrt(2*600) = 42.43 hours.

Let's start by taking the transpose of both sides of the equation. This gives us $(x^{T} A^{T} A x)^T = (x^T x)^T$. Since the transpose of a product is the product of the transposes in reverse order, we have $x^T A A^T x = x^T x$. Now, let's consider the case when $x$ is the zero vector. In this case, we have $x^T A A^T x = 0$ for any matrix $A$. This is because the zero vector has no components, so the dot product of the zero vector with any vector is zero.

        "generated_text": " The given differential equation is a first-order nonlinear ordinary differential equation. We can rewrite it as \\( y' = \\frac{y^2}{t^2} - 4y + 6 \\). To solve this, we can use the method of separation of variables. We can rewrite the equation as \\( \\frac{dy}{dt} = \\frac{y^2}{t^2} - 4y + 6 \\). Now, we can separate the variables by dividing both sides by \\( y^2 - 4y + 6 \\) and multiplying both sides by \\( dt \\). This gives us \\( \\frac{dy}{y^2 - 4y + 6} = dt \\). Integrating both sides, we get \\( \\int \\frac{dy}{y^2 - 4y + 6} = \\int dt \\). The left side can be integrated using partial fractions, and the right side is simply \\( t + C \\), where \\( C \\) is the constant of integration. After integrating, we get \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\ln \\left| \\frac{y-2}{y-3} \\right| = t + C \\). To find the constant \\( C \\), we can use the initial condition \\( y(2) = 4 \\). Substituting \\( t = 2 \\) and \\( y = 4 \\) into the equation, we get \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\ln \\left| \\frac{4-2}{4-3} \\right| = 2 + C \\). Simplifying, we get \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\ln 2 = 2 + C \\). Solving for \\( C \\), we get \\( C = \\frac{1}{2} \\ln 2 - 2 \\). Substituting this value of \\( C \\) back into the equation, we get \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\ln \\left| \\frac{y-2}{y-3} \\right| = t + \\frac{1}{2} \\ln 2 - 2 \\). To solve for \\( y \\), we can multiply both sides by 2 and exponentiate both sides to get rid of the logarithm. This gives us \\( \\ln \\left| \\frac{y-2}{y-3} \\right| = 2t + \\ln 2 - 4 \\). Exponentiating both sides, we get \\( \\left| \\frac{y-2}{y-3} \\right| = e^{2t + \\ln 2 - 4} \\). Simplifying, we get \\( \\left| \\frac{y-2}{y-3} \\right| = e^{2t} \\cdot e^{\\ln 2} \\cdot e^{-4} \\). This gives us \\( \\left| \\frac{y-2}{y-3} \\right| = 2e^{2t} \\cdot e^{-4} \\). Simplifying further, we get \\( \\left| \\frac{y-2}{y-3} \\right| = 2e^{2t-4} \\). To solve for \\( y \\), we can multiply both sides by \\( y-3 \\) and divide both sides by \\( 2e^{2t-4} \\). This gives us \\( y-2 = \\pm \\frac{y-3}{2e^{2t-4}} \\). Solving for \\( y \\), we get \\( y = 2 + \\frac{y-3}{2e^{2t-4}} \\) or \\( y = 2 - \\frac{y-3}{2e^{2t-4}} \\).

Substituting \\( t = 2 \\) and \\( y = 4 \\) into the equation, we get \\( 4 = 2 + \\frac{4-3}{2e^{2(2)-4}} \\). Simplifying, we get \\( 4 = 2 + \\frac{1}{2e^0} \\).

        "generated_text": " We are given that $f$ is an analytic function on the open unit disk $\\mathbb{D}$ and that $|f| < 2$. We are also given that $f''(0) = 4i$. We want to find the value of $f(i/2)$. Since $f$ is analytic, it can be represented by its Taylor series expansion around $0$, which is $f(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n z^n$. Taking the second derivative of $f$ with respect to $z$, we get $f''(z) = \\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} n(n-1) a_n z^{n-2}$. Evaluating this at $z=0$, we get $f''(0) = 2a_2$. Since we are given that $f''(0) = 4i$, we can conclude that $a_2 = 2i$. Now, we can write $f(z)$ as $f(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n z^n = a_0 + a_1 z + 2i z^2 + \\sum_{n=3}^{\\infty} a_n z^n$. We want to find the value of $f(i/2)$, so we substitute $z = i/2$ into the expression for $f(z)$: $f(i/2) = a_0 + a_1 (i/2) + 2i (i/2)^2 + \\sum_{n=3}^{\\infty} a_n (i/2)^n$. Simplifying, we get $f(i/2) = a_0 + a_1 (i/2) + 2i (-1/4) + \\sum_{n=3}^{\\infty} a_n (i/2)^n$. Since $a_0$ and $a_1$ are constants, we can ignore them in the expression for $f(i/2)$. We are left with $f(i/2) = a_1 (i/2) - 1/2 + \\sum_{n=3}^{\\infty} a_n (i/2)^n$. We can rewrite this as $f(i/2) = \\frac{a_1 i}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} + \\sum_{n=3}^{\\infty} a_n \\frac{i^n}{2^n}$.

The probability of the machine breaking before making a cup of coffee is 0.01, and the probability of the machine making a cup of coffee is 0.9. Therefore, the probability of the machine breaking before making $n$ cups of coffee is $(0.01)^n$. This is a geometric distribution with parameter $p = 0.01$. The probability of the machine making $n$ cups of coffee before breaking is $(0.9)^n$. Therefore, the probability of the machine breaking before making $n$ cups of coffee is $P(X > n) = (0.01)^n$. To find the smallest $a > 0$ such that $P(X > n) = O(a^n)$, we need to find the smallest $a$ such that $(0.01)^n = O(a^n)$. This means that $a^n$ must grow faster than $(0.01)^n$.

We can use the formula for effective rate of discount and effective rate of interest to calculate the equivalent simple interest rate. First, we calculate the effective rate of discount for the first three years: (1 - 0.03)^3 = 0.99027. Then, we calculate the effective rate of interest for the last three years: (1 + 0.05)^3 = 1.157625. Now, we need to find the equivalent simple interest rate that would give us the same effective rate of discount and effective rate of interest. We can use the formula for simple interest rate: (1 + r)^n = (1 + e)^m, where r is the simple interest rate, n is the number of years for the effective rate of discount, and m is the number of years for the effective rate of interest. In this case, n = 3 and m = 3. We can solve for r: (1 + r)^3 = (1 + 0.99027)^3 * (1 + 1.157625)^3. Solving for r, we get r = 0.06499, or 6.499%.

We know that $Y = X + Z$ and $X$ is independent of $Z$. Therefore, the conditional expectation of $Y$ given $X$ is simply the expectation of $X$ plus the expectation of $Z$. Since $X$ and $Z$ are uniformly distributed on $[0,1]$, their expectations are both $1/2$. So, $E[Y|X] = 1/2 + X$. Next, we need to find the conditional variance of $Y$ given $X$. The variance of a random variable is the expected value of the square of the random variable minus the square of the expected value of the random variable. So, we need to find $E[Y^2|X]$ and $E[Y^2]$. We know that $Y = X + Z$, so $Y^2 = (X + Z)^2 = X^2 + 2XZ + Z^2$. Therefore, $E[Y^2|X] = E[X^2|X] + 2E[XZ|X] + E[Z^2|X]$. Since $X$ and $Z$ are independent, $E[XZ|X] = E[X]E[Z] = 1/2 \\cdot 1/2 = 1/4$. Also, $E[X^2|X] = E[X^2] = 1/3$ and $E[Z^2|X] = E[Z^2] = 1/3$.

Therefore, the conditional variance of $Y$ given $X$ is $E[Y^2|X] - (E[Y|X])^2 = 1 - (1/2 + X)^2 = 1 - (1/4 + X + X^2) = 3/4 - X - X^2$. </think><answer>3/4 - X - X^2</answer>",

        "generated_text": " In an equilateral triangle, the orthocenter (the point where the altitudes intersect) is also the centroid, the circumcenter, and the incenter. This means that the point $M$ is the orthocenter of the triangle $ABC$. The distances from the orthocenter to the sides of the triangle are related to the side length of the triangle. Specifically, if $h$ is the height of the equilateral triangle, then the distance from the orthocenter to any side is $h/3$. In this case, we have $MD = 1$, $ME = 2$, and $MF = 3$. This means that the height of the equilateral triangle is $3$. The height of an equilateral triangle is related to the side length $s$ by the formula $h = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}s$.
